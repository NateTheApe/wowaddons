Tagging as 2.7.2.3_beta_3


--------------------

Archarodim:
	- - Locailization: Changed the description displayed in the Live-list's option panel giving much more detail about its use and configuration. - Added the 'Create a virtual test affliction' option in the live-list's option panel to help users to set it up properly.
	- Use a cleverer throttling when dealing with mass debuffing event
	- The "Decursive" bar had become the "BINDING_HEADER_DECURSIVE" bar
	- Fix "Dcr_Events.lua:626 attempt to index field "IsStealthBuff" (a nil value)" introduced in last commit
	- - Refactoring and improvement of the debugging report code so it's completely independent of Decursive's core. It's now able to report problems happening when parsing Decursive's files.
	- Refactoring of the initialization code so it's organized and clean and vicious runtime errors can be caught by Decursive's debugger (such as when another add-on breaks AceAddon...).
	
	- General cleanup (to be continued)
	- The Monk class button was doing nothing in the prio/skip list interface
