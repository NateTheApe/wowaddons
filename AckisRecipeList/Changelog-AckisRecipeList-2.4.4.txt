	- Updated changelog.
	- Recipes learned by books of glyph mastery may also be learned by creating scrolls of wisdom.
	- DISCOVERY_INSC_PANDARIA -> using to create.  Makes more sense.
	- Mark the MoP engineering mounts as goblin/gnome.
	- Update Flask of Supreme Power per Ticket 1536.
	- Fix integration with Mr Trader.

Ressy:
	- Updating 'Clean Pelt' - LW Trainer in Kun-Lai Summit

John Pasula:
	- Fix an issue where Custom only entries were not showing up in the list.  Probably need to update the scanner to account for these as well.
