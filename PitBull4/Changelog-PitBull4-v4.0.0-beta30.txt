Tagging as v4.0.0-beta30


--------------------

Shefki:
	- Bump TOC files for 4.3
	- Fix bug #976, flaw in Aura layout that shows up as divide by zero in 4.3
	This was arguably always a bug since it makes the layout misbeehave
	on 4.2.  Calculating the size of the aura as inf never really made
	sense.
	- Remove the HappinessIcon module I missed in the last commit.
	- Remove all references to pet Happiness.
	- Rename VisualHeal5 to just VisualHeal.  Remove ManaSpark module.
	- Delete old HealComm based VisualHeal module.
	- Fix divide by error issues with UnitFrameLayout.lua and 4.3.0
	- Fix divide by zero errors for 4.3.0
